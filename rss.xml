born young
and raised in a small town right on the border between the Wild West and the Internet;
guts and love and glory in the last two places in America
where you can truly get lost.

i don’t want to “hang out”, i want to know a love so calamitous &amp; deafening that far distant poets must take cover from our ensuing avalanche; diving under desks to attempt approximate couplets, desperate to echo even a fraction of the fusillade and thunder they saw in our hearts

i want to lean too far into an embrace, lose my balance and tumble endlessly with and into one another down the slope, gathering tailings as our descent accelerates to a breakneck plummet, until it’s impossible to sort through which pieces were mine or were yours when we started

it rained yesterday. no great storm, merely the deeply cold, petulant foot-stomping of a waned winter that insists on reminding us he was once king here. when the rain cleared, i felt myself transformed by the chlorinated blue sky that followed. the deathless bad mood i had been styling as an overcoat all winter fell from my shoulders, and with it went a sensation of heavy weight from my chest that i didn’t even know i was bearing. i stopped in the middle of the sidewalk on madison ave to reckon with how somatic the phenomenon was, and to breathe deeply for the first time in nearly a century. new york city is either drearily cold or drearily hot any day that isn’t that one sweet week in september, but i still surprised myself with the fierceness with which i coveted that rare blue sky.

since moving to new york, i’ve learned some new ways to live — i’ve eaten foods i’d never tried before, i’ve stayed up from one sunrise to the next, to the sunset beyond that, and i’ve dined my full on decades of cinematic legacy and all the countless ways to romanticize this city. but in doing all of these things, meeting so many new people, in reshaping myself every day for two years, i find myself restless and unresolved. in all of this, the thing that has delighted me most to look forward to, the moment i find myself most often fantasizing about, is packing all that i own into a rented uhaul box truck and driving it with my best friend back across the country to the West.

i don’t think i want “equity in the form of vesting options and a clear path to promotion”, i want a well-organized kitchen with open cabinets, so when the sunlight pours in through the large bifold window over the sink, it shatters into millions of prismatic shards on each glass

i want to let in the morning early spring sun &amp; its crisp breeze chaperone to glance across neatly stacked white ceramic plates and mugs, like a kind older couple at a gallery opening, and i want to watch a curious parcel of mule deer flirt between the forest and nearby clearing

if by “open to new opportunities”, you mean the infinite number of warm new days and quiet frontiers hiding in every golden plain and conversational creek in the rocky mountain west; if you mean never choosing same-day shipping or nervous meetings or unkind car horns, then yes,

i don’t mind if after all of this, my life amounts to anything by the yardstick of capital; if i don’t quite make it into the photo finish of the rat race. i think if at the end of this, all i’ve done is opened the door for strangers and lost count of sunrises, that’d be okay.

instead of redesigning your portfolio
try carefully folding it into the shape of a sailboat, letting it drift off down the creek, and enjoying the rest of your walk through the wild woods, unafflicted. 

breathe deeply from your lungs,
perhaps for the first time
in a long time.

i don’t want to “carve out a few minutes to connect about this role”, i want to carve out a little plot of land in the wild western united states and watch the sun rise over the rockies and watch the steam from my coffee drift up to intermingle with the cool mists of the morning

i want to sleep in a subalpine field among the elephantella and the limber pine and the wildflowers, running out of numbers to count the stars with,

no sound but the wind and your heartbeat

i find myself once again at the gate of the rocky mountains, the bold defenders of the western coast. the golden gaze of the sun lights the path from these quiet plains to the patient and sacred evergreen woods.

in the words of our poet cy warman,

“i just feel good all over.”
