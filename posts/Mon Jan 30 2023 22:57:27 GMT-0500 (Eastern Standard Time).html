tonight i saw a really good movie
and when it was over, i started calling everyone i loved
and telling them i loved them, and that i was glad to know them

i’ve only ever seen my own insides through gaps torn in the skin of my palms when i crashed my bike, or the hundredth time i checked my bottom teeth in the mirror, certain they’ve gotten more crooked

but i gotta be cavernous
if there’s room in me enough
for me to be so proud i am who i am
and for me to dearly want to be someone else
