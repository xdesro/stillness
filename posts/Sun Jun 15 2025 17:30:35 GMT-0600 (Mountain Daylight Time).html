anyway here’s to my father,

a man who showed me the honor to be found in quiet humility, the great kindness of great patience, the nobility of purposeful labor

a man who taught me what gold is to be enjoyed in joyful storytelling, and in dedicated eager listening; 

the passion for educating and the esurience to learn; 

the times for solemnity and observant respect, and the times for wide smiles and unfurrowed brows

a man who showed me how devotional, enduring love is made and moved: in how he loves my siblings, in how he loves my mother, in how he loves the earth, in how he loves me

here’s to my father, through whom i found there is no god we might need but what we find in each other's hearts
