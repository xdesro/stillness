i don't ever want to see your power-washing, slime-squishing, pimple-popping, domino-dropping, paint-mixing, hydraulic-pressing ✨ Content ✨ again. my attention is raw from the mechanical chafing of feeds and for-you-pages and infinite wells of engineered psychological anesthetic.

i want to stand and take a deep breath at the start of the day and put down my coffee and roll up my sleeves. i want to teach my smooth and scroll-poisoned brain once more how to seek and earn satisfaction by will and dedication; the methodical pursuit of craft mastery, the meticulous untangling of narrative in a great novel, the tending vocabulary practice in a new language until it blooms into a garden of fluency.

allora— andiamo.
