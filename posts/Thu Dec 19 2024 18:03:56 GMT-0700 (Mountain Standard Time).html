i think i need to do it all over again. i’ve got so many better ideas for a second time around — i know how to stay focused in school, or be kinder to my mother, or which heartbreaks will be worth it. i’ll warn my brother from the cliffside that day, i'll hold my tongue better, i'll trust myself.

i need to do it all over again: i’ve half-built too many dreams on these shoulders to carry with this body that’s not even half-built. i’d take surer steps in fewer directions, ask better questions and better remember the answers. they have to let me do it again: how can i choose better paths if i’m still stumbling under the weight of mistakes from the worse ones?
