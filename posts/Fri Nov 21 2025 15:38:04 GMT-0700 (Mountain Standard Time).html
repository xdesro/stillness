larping once more as a creature of sensuality, of agony, of flesh. slovenly and begrimed by these human desires, i covet victor mug burnt black coffee & acrid blue oil smoke, i scratch my back like a bear on the fry of a woman's voice. i am made to feel the ache in my retinas from raw, hot sunlight glinting off bleached santa fe sidewalks, and that timid convulsing of lungs forced to inhale the first mornings of january, and the tides of anxiety and relief in great lakes of new-relationship uncertainty. my body brings me many homes, in the comfort of familiar oncoming storm soreness in my broken hipbone, the hearthfire warmth of anaerobic acid in my muscles when i make of them unreasonable demands, the bear hug embrace of my ribs around my lungs when i am made to laugh so hard i cannot breathe.
