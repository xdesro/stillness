it’s silly and self-defeating to pretend my peace and well-being are entirely beholden to the location i’ve put down my bags in

but i spent this last week eating dinner with dear old friends, breathing deeply, and watching the sun yawn and roll itself contentedly into those mule-kicked sheets on the unmade bed of the rocky mountains 

and what i do know is that right now, i don’t feel like a ghost anymore.
