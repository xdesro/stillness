computer, Show Me Less Like This. show me Parisian streets and their denizens, show me futurist art and central american architecture. show me black forests and crystal pools, steady wildlife and bad poetry and confused yellow cabs. computer, show me the agonies of Men in love!

computer, show me the face of someone who just realized they forgot an important date. show me tears, show me stars. show me artworks that took decades to produce, or that took millennia, and show me societies that looked at stars and at dogs and show me underwater horrors I was never meant to see...

computer! quickly, show me old friends & older heartbreaks, and show me jazz musicians flowing hot in each other's veins, and show me old women playing rivalrous games like they're trying to turn themselves to ice. show me stoic, hushed midwestern landscapes, and then deep southern ones, lush & buzzing.

and show me less of these tired arguments about tedious frameworks and overwrought algorithms — computer, I gotta see Algerian nights and railroad mornings and Detroit and Santa Fe and Chiang Mai, and Ayutthaya overgrown, for good measure. computer, make my other senses desperate, make them ache and weep to be so surfeited!

computer, now that it's just you and me, Show Me Less of what these people have made of their one wild and Oliverian life — show me what I might make of mine.
