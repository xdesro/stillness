rise to stand in the mornings in the deserts of the american west and look to the edge of sight â€” see the reds and browns of the earth  bleach steadily into blue, and then into nothing. the brush in the hand of god that blends uncertainty and infinite possibility, that paints hope and adventure and big-R Romance into plain view; that shade that turns the horizon into the sky.
