listening to new wave and photographing wyoming sunrises at treeline and downshifting into every curve in the road and smelling ponderosas and piñons and being sure you know the difference, and watching a tense cowboy standoff between the two peaks at opposing ends of the valley while they dare each other to make the first move, and looking up from the trail and breathing out into a sky that really is bigger here, somehow, and taking off your sunglasses at the sunset even though it’s still too bright because you’ve never seen colors like this before.

you’re just dying to be lost in the west, again
