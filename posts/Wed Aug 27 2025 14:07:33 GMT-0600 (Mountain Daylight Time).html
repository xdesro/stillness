i would love to further my education in The Institution, be made a wise man by such wise men. but to what school might i go to learn contemporaneously of Mayakovsky & Rimbaud, of Basquiat & Wojnarowicz (their work, their world!), of Frank O’Hara & Allen Ginsberg, wild trees & wild birds & wildflowers? which Ivy campus offers an undergraduate study of art & biology & heartbreak, horny french film & horny german film & horny italian film, Barcelona & Baghdad & Bogotá, east coast swing & west coast swing & salsa while i’m at it?

i want to know the agonies of Persian poets, of Irish folk singers; the meticulousness of elephants & the corners cut by bricklayers; i want to know what mathematics might drive a man to madness. i need to know the What it all and know the Why of it all, and learn it only to love it (or hate it with the proper attentions & passions it is duly owed!)

which school will offer me such a skewed angle on this life, such a thorough tilt, such a strange degree
