standup update: i'm afraid i'm blocked for the day. the amber and umber and sienna leaves fall from the trees along 6th avenue in great exhales. they land on my book & cafe table & the sidewalk with a crisp lounge brush-snare tapping and snapping, and they then shuffle along the street, busy with gossip and errands unknown.

well, i won't be able to make any further progress on this project: i need to walk in my neighborhood and listen to the breeze as it whispers through my chest and the ribs of the sugar maples, and i need to watch the blue sky fill with gold.
